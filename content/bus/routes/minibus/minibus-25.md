## Classification and current service

The full official catalogue files 小25 under 小 (小、市民小巴).[^ebus-minibus]
The normalized TDX record retains 5 direction/variant records for this service; route history, corridor rationale and dated operator changes are not inferred from stop names or the current map.[^tdx-bus]

The full official schedule gives termini “捷運北投站 - 六窟”, the current head/last-departure field “[平日] 0520 - 2240 [假日] 0520 - 2240”, fare “一段票”.[^ebus-route-minibus-25]

## Research status

The TDX snapshot supplies the changing stop and geometry records; route length remains TBC, and no dated route history or operator-change record was promoted from the current catalogue pages.[^tdx-bus]
