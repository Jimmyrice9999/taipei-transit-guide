The Kaohsiung line index keeps three published route identities visible: the TDX Red Line, the TDX Orange Line and the operator/government Circular Light Rail.[^tdx-krtc-line][^krtc-guide-map-en][^mtbu-lrt] TDX supplies the two metro line records and directional route records, while the operator and government pages supply the LRT’s station list, alignment description and length.[^tdx-krtc-route][^mtbu-lrt]

The Red and Orange pages show the TDX route-length fields beside the government project values. The Red Line is 29.72 km in the TDX route record and 28.3 km in the government project description; the Orange Line is 13.12 km and 14.4 km respectively.[^tdx-krtc-route][^mtbu-red-orange] These are conflicts published as conflicts, not values silently reconciled into one number.[^tdx-krtc-route][^mtbu-red-orange]

The Circular Light Rail is described by the government as 22.1 km, surface light rail and 38 stations.[^mtbu-lrt] Its page has an explicit station list including C21A and C21 as separate codes, which the guide preserves.[^mtbu-lrt] The operator’s English guide map supplies the English names used by the line and station pages.[^krtc-guide-map-en]

A line page is therefore a source map as much as a route summary. It tells the reader which facts came from TDX, which came from the government’s project page and which came from the operator’s station publication.[^tdx-krtc-line][^mtbu-red-orange][^mtbu-lrt] Service frequencies, construction chronology, signalling, power and fleet history are not inferred from the station sequence and remain TBC until their primary records are transcribed.[^tdx-krtc-first-last][^krtc-station-guide-en]
